# Request a Data Point

## What is it?

The dataset isn't fixed. GoodFit adds new blocks, fields, and custom classifiers based on what partners need. If you need something that's not in the current data directory, you can request it.

## What can we build?

**New data blocks.** If you need a category of data we don't currently surface (App store data, Search intent, etc.) we'll evaluate whether our existing source infrastructure supports it or whether a new source integration is needed.

**New fields within existing blocks.** If a current block is close but missing a specific derivation or aggregation you need, we can extend it.

**AI Industry / Business Type Labels.** The AI labelling system accepts fully custom classifiers. If you need to detect "Vertical SaaS" or "Companies selling to healthcare" or "Marketplace business model," we can train and deploy a new label.

**New source integrations.** If you've got a specific data source in mind that would improve coverage for your use case, we'll evaluate adding it to the pipeline.

Build partners directly influence what gets built. If your request makes the dataset better for everyone, it ships faster.
