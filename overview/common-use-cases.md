# Common Use Cases

#### What is it?

This page describes how partners are thinking about GoodFit data in their products. These patterns are drawn from live conversations. They illustrate the range of what is possible, not a prescriptive playbook.<br>

#### Pattern 1: Account sourcing



A GTM workflow platform wants to offer a native "Build Your TAM" experience. Today, their users either scrape LinkedIn, query an expensive third-party provider, or import CSVs that are stale on arrival. The platform feels empty on day one.

With GoodFit, the partner offers an account finder powered by the sourcing engine. Users define criteria using filters the partner has configured - Department size, geography, industry, tech stack, hiring activity. Results flow continuously. New qualifying companies arrive as they enter the market. Companies that no longer qualify drop out.

What makes this different from bolting on a standard data provider is the filters. The partner's users can source based on "companies hiring data engineers in DACH" or "companies with VP-level sales leadership." These are live queries against configured data blocks, not static fields.

The partner defines which data blocks and parameters matter for their user base. GoodFit configures the dataset. The partner builds the UI. Users query the dataset as if it were native.

#### Pattern 2: Identity resolution and data hygiene



A platform is building identity resolution, unifying a customer's CRM data, product analytics, and other first-party data into a single company view. Once unified, the next step is filling in the gaps. They need a data partner who can handle both basic firmographics and deeper signals, without costing a fortune per record.

With GoodFit, the partner triggers enrichment when a company record is created or unified. One call can return 100's of  attributes. Basic company data, name, size, geography, industry, plus signals that commodity providers miss: hiring velocity, team composition, traffic trends, technology stack, NLP classifications.

The partner sees better data at a more sustainable cost than their previous provider, plus proprietary signals that did not exist in their old stack.



#### Pattern 3: Signal-based workflows



A platform enables users to build automated workflows  "every Monday, find accounts that match X, enrich with Y, push to Z." The workflows are powerful, but only as good as the data feeding them. Today, the data options are limited and expensive.

With GoodFit, the partner exposes data blocks as workflow triggers and filters. Not just "this company has 200 employees" but "this company is hiring 47 people, 34% remote, with 12 open sales roles and jobs posted outside their HQ country." Those signals become workflow inputs.

Users build automations using attributes they do not know are powered by GoodFit. The data refreshes on cadence. The workflows fire on change.

#### Common themes



Every conversation with prospective partners surfaces the same observations:

* **Fragmented data stacks.** Everyone has tried at least two providers. None alone covers the breadth of data that users actually need.
* **Engineering capacity is limited.** Partners have product roadmaps to execute. Data engineering is a distraction. They want someone to handle identity resolution, source management, refresh logic, and quality.
* **Custom signals are the differentiator.** Basic firmographics are table stakes. What gets partners interested is the GoodFit NLP layer and the ability to configure data blocks with parameters specific to their market.
