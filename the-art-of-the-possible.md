# The Art of the Possible

## What is it?

The Partner Data Platform gives you access to GoodFit's full company intelligence layer — 296 attributes across 25 data blocks from 14+ live sources — delivered under your brand.

You configure the dataset once. Your customers use it to source accounts and enrich companies without knowing GoodFit exists. The data appears as your own proprietary intelligence, inside your platform.

## Why does it matter?

Most platforms that need company data end up in the same place. They start with one provider, find it too shallow. Add a second. Maybe a third. They end up managing multiple contracts, multiple schemas, inconsistent refresh cadences, and data that still is not good enough.

Common patterns we see:

* **People Data Lab** for enrichment — expensive for data that customers describe as okay, not great
* **Crunchbase** for company data — useful for VC-backed tech, but limited coverage outside that universe
* **Apollo** for contact and company data — shut down partner access for anyone they consider a competitor
* **LinkedIn scraping** — grey zone, breaks regularly, and creates compliance risk
* **Custom web scraping pipelines** — expensive to maintain, fragile, and hard to keep fresh

The Partner Data Platform replaces all of these with a single integration. One dataset. One schema. One refresh cadence. One partner.

## What can your customers do with it?

**Source accounts.** Your customers define their market using filters you have configured — company size, geography, industry, tech stack, hiring activity, team composition. They receive a continuously refreshed set of qualifying companies. New companies arrive as they enter the market. Companies that no longer qualify drop out.

**Enrich companies.** Your customers pass a domain and get back structured data across every block in your dataset. Firmographics, hiring signals, team composition, traffic, tech stack, funding, reviews, and proprietary NLP classifications. One call.

**Work with signals that exist nowhere else.** GoodFit's NLP models read and classify company websites at scale. That produces signals no third-party database contains:

* `is_b2b` / `is_b2c` with probability scores
* `is_saas` — SaaS detection from website and product signals
* `gtm_model` — Product-Led or Sales-Assisted classification
* `classification_model` — fully custom classifiers you define

These require actually reading the website, which only GoodFit does at scale.

## What makes this different?

**Dynamic blocks as filters.** No other provider lets your customers source accounts based on "companies hiring data engineers in DACH" or "companies with VP-level sales leadership." These are not static fields in a database. They are live queries against the data blocks you configured when building your dataset.

**Coverage beyond the usual universe.** GoodFit covers companies that other providers do not index — niche verticals, SMBs, non-VC-backed businesses, international markets. If your customers sell to dentists, insurance brokers, hospitality providers, or professional service firms, we cover them.

**Proprietary NLP intelligence.** B2B/SaaS classification, GTM model detection, and custom classification models are generated by GoodFit's models. They cannot be replicated by switching to another data provider.
