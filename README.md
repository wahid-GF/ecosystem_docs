# GoodFit Platform Data

{% hint style="success" %}
**Your platform. Your configuration. Our intelligence.**
{% endhint %}

GoodFit powers your dataset with 100s of attributes across 10 data blocks out of the box and more upon request. You configure the data layer once, choosing which blocks and parameters matter for your product. Allowing you to then open access inside your platform without having to maintain their own data infrastructure and contracts.

## What your customers get

<table data-view="cards">
<thead><tr>
  <th></th>
  <th></th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td><a href="what-your-customers-get/account-sourcing.md"><strong>Account Sourcing</strong></a></td>
  <td>Your customers build their market from your dataset. They define their market, preview qualifying companies, and source continuously refreshed accounts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><a href="what-your-customers-get/enrichment.md"><strong>Enrichment</strong></a></td>
  <td>Your customers pass a company and get back 100s of attributes. Firmographics, hiring, traffic, tech, funding, reviews, all from one provider.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Both capabilities draw from the same data blocks listed below. You configure the blocks once. Your customers use them as sourcing filters or enrichment fields.

## What you configure

These blocks form your dataset. You define the parameters. Your customers query the result.

## Partner programme

We want to understand how data needs to live in your product and we'll shape delivery around that. Check out [Getting Started](technical-integration/getting-started.md) for the technical onboarding path.

## Don't see what you need?

The dataset isn't fixed. We add new blocks, fields, and custom classifiers based on what partners need.
