# GoodFit Platform Data

{% hint style="success" %}
**Your platform. Your configuration. Our intelligence.**
{% endhint %}

GoodFit powers your dataset with hundreds of attributes across 25 data blocks from dozens of live sources. You configure the data layer once, choosing which blocks, parameters, and quality thresholds matter for your market. Your customers see it as your data, inside your platform. They never see GoodFit.

## What your customers get

| Capability | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [**Account Sourcing**](what-your-customers-get/account-sourcing.md) | Customers build their TAM from your dataset. They define their market, preview qualifying companies, and get continuously refreshed accounts. |
| [**Enrichment**](what-your-customers-get/enrichment.md) | Customers pass a company and get back up to 296 attributes. Firmographics, hiring, traffic, tech, funding, reviews, all from one provider. |

Both capabilities draw from the same data blocks listed below. You configure the blocks once. Customers use them as sourcing filters or enrichment fields.

## What you configure

These blocks form your dataset. You define the parameters. Customers query the result.

**Core** blocks return the same fields for every company.

**Dynamic** blocks accept your parameters (keywords, countries, departments, technographics, rating filters) for a tailored configuration. Each parameter combination produces distinct data points and sourcing results. You set these once when building your dataset.

## Partner programme

We want to understand how data needs to live in your product and we'll shape delivery around that. See [Common Use Cases](overview/common-use-cases.md) for how early integrations are taking shape, or [Getting Started](technical-integration/getting-started.md) for the technical onboarding path.

## Don't see what you need?

The dataset isn't fixed. We add new blocks, fields, sources, and custom classifiers based on partner requirements.
