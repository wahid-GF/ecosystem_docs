# Enrichment

## What is it?

Enrichment fills in everything that is missing about the companies your customers already have. Your customers pass a company — a domain, a name, a CRM ID — and get back up to 296 structured attributes from your dataset.

Firmographics, hiring signals, team composition, traffic, tech stack, funding, reviews, and proprietary NLP classifications. One call. Structured, typed, sourced data back.

## Why is it useful?

Your customers already have accounts in their CRM, product analytics, or spreadsheets. What they do not have is the data to actually work those accounts — to segment, prioritise, score, and route them effectively.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Most enrichment options today are either expensive for mediocre quality, have shut down partner access, or require scraping that breaks regularly and creates compliance risk. None of them can tell you whether a company is Product-Led or Sales-Assisted, because that requires actually reading the website.
{% endhint %}

Enrichment turns your platform into the single source of company intelligence. One integration replaces your entire enrichment stack.

With Enrichment, you can:

* Fill missing fields across your customers' existing account records
* Offer a "click to enrich" or automatic enrichment experience in your UI
* Replace multiple data vendor integrations with one
* Access proprietary NLP classifications that exist nowhere else
* Keep data current with scheduled batch enrichment or webhook updates

## How it works

**1. You define what is in the dataset.** Working with GoodFit, you choose which data blocks and attributes are included. You configure Dynamic blocks with the parameters that matter for your customer base. This is your dataset, tuned to your market.

**2. Your customer passes a company.** A domain, a name, a CRM ID. One identifier. Your platform resolves it against your dataset and returns the enrichment data you have made available.

**3. Structured data comes back.** Every field is typed, sourced, and fresh. Your customer sees the data inside your platform — it is your data, your UI, your experience. GoodFit is invisible.

**4. Data stays current.** Batch enrich on a schedule, or receive webhook updates when something changes. No data point older than 30 days. High-traffic companies refresh continuously.

## Proprietary intelligence

{% hint style="success" %}
These fields are generated by GoodFit's NLP models that read and classify company websites. They exist nowhere else.
{% endhint %}

* `is_b2b` / `is_b2c` with probability scores
* `is_saas` — SaaS detection from website and product signals
* `gtm_model` — Product-Led or Sales-Assisted classification
* `classification_model` — fully custom classifiers you define

No third-party database contains these. They require reading the actual website, which only GoodFit does at scale.
