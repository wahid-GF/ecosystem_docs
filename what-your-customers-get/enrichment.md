# Enrichment

## What is it?

Enrichment fills in everything that's missing about companies your customers already have. They pass a company (a domain, a name, a CRM ID) and get back 100s of structured attributes from your dataset.

Firmographics, hiring signals, team composition, traffic, tech stack, funding, reviews, and proprietary NLP classifications. One call, structured data back.

## Why is it useful?

Your customers have accounts in their CRM, product analytics, or spreadsheets. What they don't have is the data to actually work those accounts: segmenting, prioritising, scoring, and routing them effectively.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Most enrichment options out there are expensive for mediocre quality, have shut down partner access, or rely on scraping that breaks regularly and creates compliance risk. None of them can tell you whether a company is Product-Led or Sales-Assisted, because that requires actually reading the website.
{% endhint %}

Enrichment turns your platform into the single source of company intelligence. One integration replaces the entire enrichment stack.

Here's what that unlocks:

* Fill missing fields across existing account records
* Offer a "click to enrich" or automatic enrichment experience in your UI
* Replace multiple data vendor integrations with one
* Get proprietary NLP classifications that don't exist anywhere else
* Keep data current with scheduled batch enrichment or webhook updates

## How it works

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Define the dataset

You work with GoodFit to choose which data groups and attributes are included. You configure groups with the parameters that matter for your customer base. Your dataset, tuned to your market.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Customer passes a company

A domain, a name, a CRM ID. One identifier. Your platform resolves it against your dataset and returns the enrichment data you've made available.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Structured data comes back

Every field is typed, sourced, and fresh. Customers see it inside your platform. Your data, your UI, your experience. GoodFit is invisible.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Data stays current

Batch enrich on a schedule, or get webhook updates when something changes. No data point older than 30 days. High-traffic companies refresh continuously.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Proprietary intelligence

{% hint style="success" %}
These fields are generated by GoodFit's NLP models that read and classify company websites. They don't exist anywhere else.
{% endhint %}

<details open>

<summary>Proprietary NLP fields</summary>

* `is_b2b` / `is_b2c` with probability scores
* `is_saas`: SaaS detection from website and product signals
* `gtm_model`: Product-Led or Sales-Assisted classification
* `classification_model`: fully custom classifiers you define

</details>

No third-party database has these. They require reading the actual website, and only GoodFit does that at scale.
