# Enrichment

## What is it?

Enrichment fills in everything that's missing about companies you or your customers already have. Pass a company (Domain, Linkedin Company URL) and get back 100s of structured attributes from your dataset.

Firmographics, hiring signals, team composition, traffic, tech stack, funding, reviews, and proprietary AI Models. One call, structured data back.

## Why is it useful?

{% hint style="success" %}
GoodFit provides packaged, tested, and market-validated data blocks.
{% endhint %}

Your customers have accounts in their CRM, product analytics, or spreadsheets. What they don't have is the data to actually work those accounts: segmenting, scoring, and routing them effectively.

Enrichment turns your product into the single source of company intelligence. One integration replaces the entire enrichment stack.

Unlocks:

* **Resolved identity resolution.** Pass a domain, or Linkedin company URL and get back a matched company record with 100s of attributes filled in.
* **Consolidated breadth of data sources from one provider.** Firmographics, hiring, traffic, tech stack, funding, reviews, and proprietary AI models. All from GoodFit, not stitched together from five vendors.
* **No need to build your own data infrastructure.** GoodFit handles sourcing, cleaning, normalising, and refreshing the data. Your engineering team plugs in, not builds from scratch.
* **Raw data for custom agents.** Every enrichment field is structured, typed, and available as raw data. Your product can pipe it into custom AI agents, scoring models, or workflow automations without transformation overhead.

## How it works

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**Define the dataset**

You work with GoodFit to choose which data blocks and attributes are included. You configure blocks with the parameters that matter for your product. Your dataset, tuned to your platform.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Customer passes a company**

A domain, a name, a CRM ID. One identifier. Your platform resolves it against your dataset and returns the enrichment data you've made available.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Structured data comes back**

Every field is typed, sourced, and fresh. Customers see it inside your platform. Your data, your UI, your experience. Maintain all the data dynamically in your backend opening up any refresh workflows to your customers: batch, schedule, trigger based.
