# Enrichment

## What is it?

Enrichment fills in everything that's missing about companies your customers already have. They pass a company (a domain, a name, a CRM ID) and get back 100s of structured attributes from your dataset.

Firmographics, hiring signals, team composition, traffic, tech stack, funding, reviews, and proprietary NLP classifications. One call, structured data back.

## Why is it useful?

Your customers have accounts in their CRM, product analytics, or spreadsheets. What they don't have is the data to actually work those accounts: segmenting, scoring, and routing them effectively.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Most enrichment options out there are expensive for mediocre quality, have shut down partner access, or rely on scraping that breaks regularly and creates compliance risk.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Enrichment turns your platform into the single source of company intelligence. One integration replaces the entire enrichment stack.

Unlocks:&#x20;

* Fill missing fields across existing account records
* Replace multiple data vendor integrations with one
* Access proprietary data points that don't exist anywhere else

## How it works

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Define the dataset

You work with GoodFit to choose which data groups and attributes are included. You configure groups with the parameters that matter for your customer base. Your dataset, tuned to your market.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Customer passes a company

A domain, a name, a CRM ID. One identifier. Your platform resolves it against your dataset and returns the enrichment data you've made available.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Structured data comes back

Every field is typed, sourced, and fresh. Customers see it inside your platform. Your data, your UI, your experience. Maintain all the data dynamically in your backend openeing up any refresh workflows to your customers: batch, schedule, trigger based
