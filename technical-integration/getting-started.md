# Getting Started

#### What is it?



This section covers the path from first conversation to live data. We are in build partner stage, so the process is collaborative rather than prescriptive.

#### What we need from you



Before anything technical happens, we need to understand three things:

* **Your use cases.** Sourcing, enrichment, or both. Are your users building TAMs, enriching CRM records, triggering workflows, or something else?
* **What data is in your product today.** Where does it come from? What is working? What is broken? What providers are you using, and what would you change?
* **How your engineering team wants to consume data.** Database access? Flat file drops to S3? API calls? We will shape delivery around what is lowest-lift for you.

#### How it works



You can think of onboarding in five steps.

**1. Discovery call.** Walk us through your product, your user base, and where company data fits. We share what we think is possible and identify the right starting point. Usually one to two calls.

**2. Dataset configuration.** Working with your GoodFit partnership lead, you define which data blocks are included, how Dynamic blocks are configured, and which attributes matter for your market. We handle the data engineering.

**3. Delivery setup.** Agree on delivery format and mechanism. Could be flat file to S3, database access, or API endpoints — depends on your architecture. We configure our side. You configure ingestion on yours.

**4. Initial delivery and validation.** Receive your first data. Validate coverage, attribute quality, and schema compatibility. Iterate on configuration if needed. Most partners do one to two rounds of refinement.

**5. Production activation.** Lock in the configuration. Activate automated refresh. Ship it to your users.
