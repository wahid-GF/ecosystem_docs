# Getting Started

## What is it?

Here's how you go from first call to live data in your product. The process is collaborative rather than prescriptive.

## What we need from you

Before anything technical happens, we need to understand three things:

* **Your use cases.** Sourcing, enrichment, or both. Are your users building their TAM, enriching CRM records, triggering workflows, or something else?
* **What data's in your product today.** Where does it come from? What's working? What's broken? What providers are you using, and what would you change?

## How it works

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Discovery call

Walk us through your product, your user base, and where company data fits in. We'll then align on the right starting point. Usually one to two calls.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Dataset configuration

With your GoodFit partnership lead, you'll define which companies are in scope, how data blocks are structured, and which attributes matter for your product. We handle the data engineering.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Delivery setup

We agree on format and delivery mechanism. We configure our side, you configure ingestion on yours.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Initial delivery and validation

You'll receive your first dataset. Validate coverage, attribute quality, and schema compatibility. If anything needs tweaking, we iterate.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Production activation

Lock in the configuration. Activate automated refresh. Ship it to your users.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
