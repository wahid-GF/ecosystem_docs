# Team

The shape of a company's workforce. Total headcount, geographic distribution, how many people work outside HQ or office locations, and whether employees match your configured criteria (departments, seniority, titles). Great for understanding team composition and remote work patterns.

{% hint style="info" %}
Team data reveals how distributed a company is. Partners use it to identify remote-first companies, spot international expansion, or find companies with specific departmental strengths.
