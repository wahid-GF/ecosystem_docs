# Employee Sentiment

How employees feel about working at a company. CEO approval, review ratings, interview difficulty, and recommendation rates give your customers a window into company culture and employer brand.

{% hint style="info" %}
Culture signals are a differentiator that most data providers don't offer. Partners surface these to help customers identify companies going through leadership changes, cultural shifts, or rapid growth strain.
