# Hiring

Everything about a company's current hiring activity. Total open roles, where they're hiring, keyword-matched job postings, and how much of their hiring happens outside their HQ or office locations. One of the most time-sensitive signal groups in the dataset.

{% hint style="info" %}
Hiring data refreshes daily — the fastest cadence in the dataset. Partners use it to detect growth, expansion into new markets, and technology adoption in near real-time.
