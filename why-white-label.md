# Why White Label

### What is it?

White label means GoodFit data lives inside your product with no GoodFit branding visible to your customers. The data appears as your own proprietary intelligence. Your customers use your UI, your filters, your terminology. GoodFit handles the data engineering behind the scenes.

### Why is it useful?

Every product team building B2B software eventually faces the same question: where does company data come from?

The options are familiar. License from a commodity provider and accept shallow records. Build an in-house pipeline and commit engineering headcount to a problem that is not your core product. Or stitch together three or four vendor APIs, each with different schemas, refresh cadences, and reliability characteristics.

The white label approach resolves this by giving you a single, deep intelligence layer that you configure once and expose as your own.

By using the Partner Data Platform, you can:

* Replace fragmented data vendor relationships with one integration
* Offer account sourcing and enrichment as native features in your product
* Access proprietary NLP signals that your competitors cannot replicate by switching providers
* Avoid committing engineering headcount to data infrastructure
* Control which data blocks and attributes your customers see

### What does it include?

| Aspect | What you get |
| --- | --- |
| **Branding** | No GoodFit branding surfaces in your product |
| **Configuration** | You choose which blocks, parameters, and quality thresholds matter |
| **Delivery** | Flat file, database access, or API — shaped to your architecture |
| **Coverage** | 296 attributes across 25 data blocks from 14+ live sources |
| **Freshness** | No data point older than 30 days |
| **Proprietary signals** | NLP classifications (B2B, SaaS, GTM model, predictive labels) |
| **Support** | Dedicated partnership lead and technical onboarding |

### Who is it for?

The Partner Data Platform is designed for companies where company data is a feature of the product, not the product itself.

This typically includes CRM platforms, sales engagement tools, ABM products, conversational intelligence platforms, GTM workflow builders, and RevOps tooling. Your customers need company intelligence to do their jobs. They should not need to source it themselves.

### How do commercials work?

GoodFit supports multiple commercial models, matched to how your product monetises data:

* **Commitment-based** — Fixed volume of enrichment or sourcing credits per period. Best for predictable usage patterns.
* **Usage-driven** — Pay-per-record pricing tied to actual consumption. Best for products with variable or growing demand.
* **Strategic partnership** — Custom pricing for deep integrations where GoodFit data is a core product pillar.

Your GoodFit partnership lead will recommend the model that fits your usage profile and growth trajectory.

### Build partner programme

We are in build partner stage. That means flexibility in how we scope, deliver, and price the integration. We want to understand your use cases and shape the offering around what your product and your customers actually need.

What we need from you to get started:

* Your use cases — sourcing, enrichment, or both
* What data is in your product today and where it falls short
* How your engineering team would ideally consume new data

We handle the rest.
